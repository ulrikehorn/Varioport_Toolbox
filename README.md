# Varioport_Toolbox

This toolbox processes data recorded with the Varioport device. With this device the amplitude and time point of peaks can be located. For peak analysis the findpeaks function in Matlab 2018b is used. A task/rest design can be defined either by defining a start and a fixed design manually or automatically by the script.
The background amplitude is estimated for several rest time points and substracted.
The results can be saved in an Excel-file.
